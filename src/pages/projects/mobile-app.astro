        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          A community-focused mobile application currently under development. This project is being kept 
          intentionally vague for now as the concept is still a bit vague to me as well.
        </p>
        <p>
          The primary goal of this project is to learn mobile app development while building something 
          open-source. The app will be developed with modern mobile development practices, 
          prioritizing user experience, accessibility, and cross-platform compatibility. More details will be 
          shared as the project takes shape.
        </p>
